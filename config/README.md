## Per-Sample Configuration

Per-sample configuration is stored in `samples.tsv`, where each row corresponds to one run of the pipeline. 

**Experiment** is the ENCODE accession ID of the sample's dataset.

**Replicate** is the biological replicate number of the sample on the ENCODE portal.

**Genome** specifies the target genome for alignment and analysis. The pipeline currently supports the GRCh38 (human) and mm10 (mouse) genomes.
